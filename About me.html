      <p>Que onda me cuhh, i am Kevin people can call me 
      El Compa Chato. I was born in oakland
      and yes I am a citizen. My mom was born in Mexico and
      I dont know from what part. Me and my family have been 
      living here in oakland for about 13- 14 years. Something
      intersting about me is that I bought a PS4 about a year
      ago but I hardly use it so I want to sell it.</p> <b>
      
      <p>my favorite show to watch on netflix right now would
      have to be that "that 70's show" but my 2 top favorite shows
      are for surely "The Flash" and "Supernatrual". And
      my favorite game would have to be GTA 5. And My
      favorite artist right now are called Herencia de 
      Patrones, Marca MP & Natanael Cano.</p>
